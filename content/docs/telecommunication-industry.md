India has more than a billion active mobile subscriptions and millions of users are
getting added every quarter. Telecom
industry, however, has been unable to
adequately ramp up infrastructure
and customer service to help resolve
customer complaints in a timely
manner. And in today’s environment,
high quality of service is a competitive
advantage for a service provider.
Service providers must continually
strive to improve their quality of
service if they want to keep
customers. If too much time is spent
simply reacting to customer
complaints, there may not be enough
time to improve overall service
quality. And the situation worsens if
the customer is not able to provide necessary and timely information regarding the
issue he or she faced. This makes it extremely difficult to perform root cause
analysis and resolve the issue.


Our Solution
• IntentAware combines and leverages existing data infrastructure and
technology in place in combination with its proprietary engine (IA Engine), to
construct and establish meaningful reports for service engineers to improve
service delivery.
• IA engine analyzes all call drop logs and uses machine learning to detect and
predict areas, which are problematic and report back in almost real-time
back to QA engineers to take action
• Establish non-intrusive way to collect device-level data from customers
(installation of IA script into Telco phone app / strategy for creation of Telco
app to gather data intelligence for continuous improvement.

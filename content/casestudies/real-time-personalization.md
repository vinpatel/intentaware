+++



## Background:
<p>Grapple.co is a task management and collaboration software that allows team members to come together in a single platform and streamline their work flow and communication. Like any other SAAS company they wanted to target and retain a customer base that was active, engaged and likely to recommend their solution to other project teams.
While they had a successful acquisition program in place, usage and retention was becoming a key issue. Without a deep engagement, there was little chance of benefitting from the "network" effect for the company.</p>

<p>Umesh Lalwani, a co-founder of Grapplee and the Director of Technology had gone to school with Arvind Singh, the founder of IntentAware.  Ashish asked Arvind for the IntentAware tag to be added to the Grapple App in an effort to find out if he could learn more about their user base.</p>
## Implementation:
<p>As with any SAAS business, the immediate goal is to nudge the website visitor to sign up for a free trial and try the product for a run. Which in many cases means that the sign-up form has minimal fields devoted to asking questions that a business might find helpful down the road.
This friction-less environment was causing issues for Grapple down the road in terms of low new feature adoption use of the full feature set of the solution. Opt-in email rate was low and the suggestions during a users task behavior were being dismissed in increasing numbers, even though the feature set being suggested would help the end user.
Ashish tagged all the key actions in the Grapple App with the IntentAware tag.  Based on the feedback provided, content for two webinars was produced when the team at IntentAware brought additional findings to the table.</p>
## Insight:
<p>As the App operates in an authenticated environment, IntentAware was able to take the emails from  the Webinar sign up form and associate them with the customer journey associated with that email address. IntentAware proposed that the content of the webinars modified based on the issues that were being surfaced in the customer journey of these known users rather than the customer base as a whole.
Umesh Lalwani was very excited and receptive to the suggestion and decided to go a step further. As the content for the first webinar was already complete he decided to treat the first webinar as a control and the second webinar as a test variation.</p>

## Results
<p>The customers that attended the second webinar, demonstrated a retention rate that was 17X higher than the ones that attended the first webinar.
According to Umesh Lalwani, â€œWe were looking at IntentAware as only a web analytics tool that could provide us insight. We were wrong. The insights provided are akin to a personalization too that connects our web, App and email audience and helps us view user activity through a single lens.</p>

<p>Ad spending on paid digital media by the US financial services was about &amp;7.2 billion in 2015 – a gain of 14.5% over 2014 and the trend continues for at least next five years with a CAGR of 11.7%1 (eMarketer, September 2015). But what about returns on this astronomical investment? A dismal 0.003%! Clearly, something is missing. And the most obvious is random targeting – these are the people who don’t care about your product or are not in the market yet advertisers keep investing on random targeting in the hope to sell. Result is poor conversion rate.</p>

<p>Research shows that more than 2/3rd of the prospects use the Internet for research and comparison activities before purchasing. As a result, Internet houses a lot of intent data of these prospects as potential buyers navigate across different auto websites. Until now, as a financial institution, you don’t have this real time prospect insights i.e., who is visiting your website, looking for a credit card, checking mortgage rates, etc.</p>

<p>IntentAware™ is meeting this need and adding value to Banking Industry through real time actionable online customer intelligence. We have developed a full enterprise grade data management platform that holds anonymous user profiles for well over half a billion users around the world. These profiles get updated in real time. Our proprietary decision engine is constantly evaluating these profiles and aggregates valuable auto shopping and research activities across the Internet. This enables auto marketers to reach prospective buyers in their intent path when they are most likely to be influenced and make purchase decisions – hence, running an effective campaign that enhances customer engagement and ultimately conversion rate.</p>

<p>Unlike ad networks, IntentAware™ does not sell ads or impressions; we simply provide real-time online customer intelligence for marketers, ad networks or publishers to boost the quality and scale of their ad campaigns.</p>
